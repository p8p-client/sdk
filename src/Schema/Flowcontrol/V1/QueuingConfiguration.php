    /**
     * @param int|null $handSize         `handSize` is a small positive number that configures the shuffle sharding of requests into queues.  When enqueuing a request at this priority level the request's flow identifier (a string pair) is hashed and the hash value is used to shuffle the list of queues and deal a hand of the size specified here.  The request is put into one of the shortest queues in that hand. `handSize` must be no larger than `queues`, and should be significantly smaller (so that a few heavy flows do not saturate most of the queues).  See the user-facing documentation for more extensive guidance on setting this field.  This field has a default value of 8.
     * @param int|null $queueLengthLimit `queueLengthLimit` is the maximum number of requests allowed to be waiting in a given queue of this priority level at a time; excess requests are rejected.  This value must be positive.  If not specified, it will be defaulted to 50.
     * @param int|null $queues           `queues` is the number of queues for this priority level. The queues exist independently at each apiserver. The value must be positive.  Setting it to 1 effectively precludes shufflesharding and thus makes the distinguisher method of associated flow schemas irrelevant.  This field has a default value of 64.
